            Junior animator for Dreamworkspro International Limited <br>
            September 2021 - March 2022 
        </h4>
        <p>
            During this kickstart job, I was responsible for drawing concept art for the shots and characters of an educational animation. After this, I completed an animation for one of these educational animations.<br>
            This job required me to swiftly learn new software such as Clip Studio Max, while also attending two meetings each day with Google Meet to organise daily tasks and keep track of progress.

            Coding course (3 - weeks) at Code Nation <br>
            June 2022 - July 2022
        </h4>
        <p>
            During this course, I was taught the fundamentals of Python, html and CSS. <br>
            During the second week of the course, I worked with a group to make a text-based adventure game with Python. We successfully created a high quality text-based adventure game that took place inside an arcade. <br>
            The third week had me learn how to use html and CSS. I utilised these newfound skills to create the very website you're reading right now.

            My time at university taught me a lot about game development and the teamwork required to complete such a large project.
            This is where I first studied and utilised the AGILE workflow, while also refining my teamwork skills. <br>
            I also studied 3D modelling software like Blender and 2D art packages like Photoshop.
