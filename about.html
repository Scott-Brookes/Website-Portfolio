        <p>
            After my multitude of studies over the years, I've learnt that my most valuable asset is my versatility. <br>
            I'm very adpative to new software and situations. For example, during a coding course with Code Nation, I quickly adapted to Python and led my team into creating a high quality text-base adventure game in the space of a week. <br>
            <br>
            I also possess organisational skills that are valuable in any project. This includes knowledge of the AGILE workflow and associated software (e.g. the kanban software Trello).
